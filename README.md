# Spring Async Playground

## What Is This?

This Spring Boot project is a basic framework to allow devs to try out things with the Spring `@Async` framework. As new ideas/tests are tried and created they will be added to the `AppRunner.java` class. The Idea is to build up several different configurations and have them documented for use in the future.
